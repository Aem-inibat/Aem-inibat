Hi, I am @Aem-inibat! Nothing related to Batman*, see below:
- I am interested in optimising plant phenotyping data processing and analysis leading to better and more sustainable production ðŸŒ±
- I am currently developing a procedure to help plant breeding research in gaining more precise insights in physiolocal responses to abiotic stresses using a gravimetric sensor
- I am looking to collaborate on pioneering projects to making comprehensive plant phenotyping measurements and analysis through phenotyping platforms
- ðŸ“« Always eager to exchange on coding and knowledge to constantly enhancing our understanding of plant morpho-physiology
- âš¡(I do have something in common with Batman, I like dark themes.)
